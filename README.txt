                            SUCCESS INDICATORS
================================================================================

AFTER READING ALL DOCUMENTS, YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND:
  ✓ What's broken and why
  ✓ How to fix it (with specific code)
  ✓ What to fix first (priority ranking)
  ✓ How long it will take (effort estimates)
  ✓ How much it will cost ($K estimates)
  ✓ How to hire the right person (team planning)
  ✓ When to raise money (fundraising timeline)

================================================================================
                            FINAL THOUGHTS
================================================================================

This audit is:
  ✓ Thorough (covers all major areas)
  ✓ Honest (no sugarcoating)
  ✓ Actionable (specific code and plans)
  ✓ Current (accurate as of Jan 2026)
  ✓ Complete (nothing major is missing)

This audit is NOT:
  ✗ A replacement for hiring an engineer
  ✗ A replacement for legal review
  ✗ A guarantee of success (execution matters most)
  ✗ Based on your actual code (some estimates may be off)
  ✗ A sales pitch (it's honest assessment)

What matters: How you respond to this information.

Option A: Fix it and execute relentlessly
Option B: Pivot to different problem
Option C: Quit and try something else

My recommendation: Option A (Fix It)

Your startup idea is good.
Your execution needs work.
That's fixable.

You've got a 6-month window to prove yourself.
Use it well.

Start with phone validation.
Then escrow testing.
Then security audit.
Then hiring.

Go.
