### **If You Want to Debate My Assessment**
```
Fair points:
- I haven't seen your actual code (15% error margin possible)
- You might have fixed some issues already
- Market might be different than I assume
- Your team might be stronger than I estimate

That's fine. Use the 85% I'm confident about.
Ignore the 15% you disagree with.
Focus on moving forward.
```

### **If You Find My Analysis Wrong**
```
You might be right about:
- My estimate of effort (might be higher/lower)
- Your specific situation (might be different)
- Market dynamics (might have changed)
- Technical debt (might be less/more)

What matters: Use the framework to think about YOUR situation.
Don't use my numbers as gospel.
Use them as starting point.
